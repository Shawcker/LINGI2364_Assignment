We also took into account the huge amount of pre-make tests that are provided by the \texttt{rfeed.tests} library, allowing us to avoid reinventing the wheel. \newline
Note that the \texttt{rfeed.tests} is written in unittest, which does not comply with the requirement of our project. In order to preserve the continuity of our test modules, we inherit the spirit of the pre-make tests and at the same time completely rewrite the tests by pytest, rather than directly quoting existing tests in \texttt{rfeed.tests}. \newline
The new RSS tests mainly realize two functions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Testing that the desired element has been correctly written in the xml file.
    \item Testing that a customized error is raised and necessary warning information is provided when some of the compulsory elements are omitted.
\end{enumerate}
