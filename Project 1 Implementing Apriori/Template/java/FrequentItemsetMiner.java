/**
 * Skeleton class for the project 1 of the LINGI2364 course.
 * Use this as main class of your jar file.
 *
 * This class and the Dataset classes are given to you as a skeleton for your implementation of the Apriori and Depth
 * First Search algorithms. You are not obligated to use them and are free to write any class or method as long as the
 * following requirements are respected:
 *
 * Your apriori and alternativeMiner methods must take as parameters a string corresponding to the path to a valid
 * dataset file and a double corresponding to the minimum frequency.
 * You must write on the standard output (System.out) all the itemsets that are frequent in the dataset file according
 * to the minimum frequency given. Each itemset has to be printed on one line following the format:
 * [<item 1>, <item 2>, ... <item k>] (<frequency>).
 * Tip: you can use Arrays.toString(int[] a) to print an itemset.
 *
 * The items in an itemset must be printed in lexicographical order. However, the itemsets themselves can be printed in
 * any order.
 *
 * The main method will be the one called by the test script. Do not change it.
 *
